# boonstra-latex
This is a collection of $\LaTeX$ commands that I, D. Erik Boonstra, find useful.

# Installation

Using the article titled [*What is installed*](https://tug.org/mactex/What_Is_Installed.pdf) by the $\TeX$ User Group, to install these files locally for a specific user of $\TeX$ Live, copy the files to `~/Library/texmf/`, where `~/Library` is the Library folder in that user's home directory. The `texmf` and other folders for the file path will have to be created. For instance, $\TeX$ will find any file in `~/Library/texmf/tex` or a subfolder of this location, $\LaTeX$ will find any file in `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex` or a subfolder of this location. Thus, `boonstra-latex` will need to be copied to `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/boonstra-latex` for users of the $\LaTeX$ distribution.
